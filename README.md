# Hate Crimes Analysis

We analyzed a data set which detailed all instances of hate crime reported to the **UCR** (Uniform Crime Reporting) and the **NIBRS** (National Incident-Based Reporting System) from 2000 until 2017. These crimes ranged anywhere from intimidation to violent crimes, and were based on various biases, such as race, gender, sexuality, religion, etc.
